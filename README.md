# Communication-for-the-deaf
A communication framework that can help to make communication between the deaf and hearing easier.
Deaf users on one end can sign, which is captured and converted to text on the hearing users' side.
The hearing user will be able to see the translated text. Their speech can be converted to text and displayed on the deaf users' side.
